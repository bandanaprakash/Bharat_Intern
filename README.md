# Bharat Intern Data Science Internship
Welcome to the repository showcasing my data science internship projects completed at Bharat Intern! During my internship, I worked on two exciting projects that provided valuable insights of data science and machine learning.

## Task 1: SMS Classifier Project
### Overview
**Task :** propelled me into the world of text classification, where I tackled the intricate task of distinguishing spam from non-spam SMS messages. Armed with Python prowess and NLP techniques, I crafted a model to sift through messages with precision. The goal? To streamline communication and enhance efficiency!

### Project Details
- Developed a model to distinguish spam from non-spam SMS messages.
- Utilized Python prowess and NLP techniques.
- Aimed to streamline communication and enhance efficiency.


## Task 2: Cat and Dog Image Classifier

**Task :** We are developing image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.In this model I've taken a sample dataset from kaggle that contains different images of cats and dogs in two separate folders.

### Libraries used :
* Pandas – This library is used to load 2D array format and DataFrames.

* Numpy – Numpy library is used to perform large computations in a easier way.

* Matplotlib – Matplotlib library is used to visualize the predictions and models.

* Sklearn – Scikit-learn also known as Sklearn library is used to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.

* OpenCV – This OpenCV library is an open-source library mainly focused on image processing and handling.

* Tensorflow – This is an open-source library that is used to achieve complex functionalities with single lines of code.


**CONCLUSION:**
The Codsoft Data Science Internship has been an enriching experience, providing me with the skills and knowledge to tackle real-world data challenges. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to meaningful projects and look forward to applying these skills in future endeavors.
